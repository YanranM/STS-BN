# STS-BN: An efficient Bayesian network method for detecting causal SNPs

STS-BN algorithm is a score based two-stage Bayesian network method for detecting causal SNPs, where the idea of the constraint-based method and score-and-search method are both used. 

This repository provides the R code of the STS-BN algorithm. (*STS-BN.R*)

There is also an example data which can be used for algorithm demonstrations. (*example.csv*)

Pictures in the "*plots*" folder are the results of our simulation study.

The "*SimulationData*" folder contains all simulated data used in our simulation.
